fiole.filsdejoie.title: "Fils de joie"
fiole.filsdejoie.detail: "\"A laugh awaits a sentence, a word or a situation to proclaim itself. A laugh may burst forth or be stifled by a hand that tries to contain it. But if it is sincere, it cannot be contained. On the skin, its fragrance is Lady-of-the-Night, a paradoxically radiant scent!\""
fiole.filsdejoie.content: "\"This text can be taken as a declaration of my penultimate will. In order to escape what we must see and hear, I have decided to hasten death. But to save the embalmer from conducting the ceremonial rites of a funeral, I have also vowed to wait for my time lying down in a coffin. Nevertheless, in keeping with the prescribed physical regime of «less fat, less sugar, less salt», I have instructed the funeral workers to place the coffin at the centre of one of the shrines located at the back of a cemetery. This life hasn’t loved me; and so I hate it. Hating is also a way of existing, a way to keep us from the inevitability of being forgotten. The name “Fils de joie” (which means Son of joy) invites laughter. This laugh is not the halting guffaw of socialites that seeks to distance. It is rather the laugh of the disillusioned which bursts forth without reason. The laughter of those who drown their joy and their mascara in their tears, like that of «Reine» [The Queen], the owner of the Plantis Café on the \"Place du Vieux marché aux chevaux\", back in Lille. She didn’t drink but was always in a state of intoxication. Only half of her was visible, as she stood behind the counter, wiping glasses and arranging bottles. When she would emerge from her position, she would be as surprised as anyone to discover that she did indeed have legs. Her laugh was full-throated. One often refers to voices like these as hoarse or guttural, but in fact they are crackling, like a record that has been scratched from overuse. Held captive by a past that she would have liked to spit out, but which sprang forth from the depths of her laughter. Her joy was unaffected yet devoid of illusion. Each of her selves was the last. I forgot to mention that at the time, she let out two rooms at the top of the café to regulars to help them make ends meet. Under her rule, a young boy, who was already a courtesan, took in the scene. And under the smoky spell of a song by Fréhel, it was I that became... the Son of joy!\""

fiole.filleberlin.title: "La fille de Berlin"
fiole.filleberlin.detail: "\"She's a rose with thorns, don't mess with her. She's a girl who goes to extremes. When she can, she soothes; and when she wants to ... ! Her fragrance lifts you higher, she rocks and shocks.\""
fiole.filleberlin.content: "\"The glass door just closed on her smile... Never again shall I see her face, only her back, as she walks down the dirt path, her shadow growing longer every step of the way. If we take the past too literally, we may only see an illusion, like trompe-l’œil-painted curtains on a wall. Is it to avoid the sickening stench of nostalgia that one image fades away to make way for another in every sense? It seems to us that to stay alive, an image should relate to the present and not, as in the example above, voluntarily and exclusively hold on to the memory of a parting smile. To remember that behind it, a major decision incubated which, firmly anchored in the era when it was made – during childhood – would determine the future of the one who has to live without the beloved one, and who chose to live by inventing. In short, making her presence irrelevant or even unwanted, and thus giving rise to : Solitude: our territory, Fear : our alter-ego, Rage : our creation. So that together, each of us may transform a murder into a masterpiece, a demolition into a sculpture, or make a peaceful landscape into a war zone, covered in snow, as beautifully deceptive as she is. Indeed, when we scanned the picture from our perspective, zooming in on her goose bumps, never could we have guessed that by focusing on how cold she was, we would get burned? Betrayal! Penetrate her Immaculate Conception, reveal the underlying guilt and, mock her pristine path laced with our footprints. Mark the white with black, an equal opposite that in time will become its own language and writing.  Allow “us” to introduce ourselves. Without actually splitting myself in two, I am multiple, a plural me. Not majestically, but ever so modestly, I achieve the impossibility of creating my double, refusing to grant a male gender to the first person. And when it comes to verbs, I speak of them only so that I may conjugate them in every which way, but always in their feminine form. Lest this riddle set your head spinning, we shall make haste and give this enigmatic figure a face. It’s a girl! Of course, but she’s not the first, others before her committed crimes, perhaps worse. You are accomplices. Buried amidst the ruins, like a blossom cut off from the rest of the world that shall, before your very eyes, open ours. With both hands, I found the courage, in the golden Rhine and her flowing blonde mane. Upon her lips I tasted the blood of Siegfried. For my girl from Berlin was armed, poised for battle, and thus more beautiful than ever, slaying all contempt, also known as my shame, acting like a fur lining for my cloak of pride. I forced my way to where she lay drenched by a torrent of criticism, churning with Love and Hate, God and the Devil, Life and Death, and I carved a trail. And in the turmoil that closed in on me, to my anger I declared “behold her beauty!\""

fiole.ambre.title: "Ambre sultan"
fiole.ambre.detail: "\"This fragrance is not an Oriental, but an Arab and a Lutens. That being the case, don't expect it to fit in. The point of departure was a scented wax, found in a souk and long forgotten in a wooden box. The amber only became sultanesque after I reworked the composition using cistus, a herb that sticks to the fingers like tar, then added an overtone that nobody had ever dreamed of : vanilla."
fiole.ambre.content: "\"Sumptuous, comfortable, singular. A perfume like no other. It explores new paths, dispels pre-conceived ideas. This masculine fragrance is not a perfume for men.It is a high-calibre perfume for dukes, kings and sultans...I learned everything I know about fragrance in Morocco.Many years ago I found a piece of amber there. I was left spellbound by its deep, sensual fragrance.Moroccan women were wearing it, protecting it under gold and silver jewellery. As for me, I placed it here and there in my home in Marrakesh.Since then I have been dreaming of using it to make a perfume for myself, a sublimated amber, the most sensual of all fragrances.\""

fiole.fleursdoranger.title: "Fleurs d'oranger"
fiole.fleursdoranger.detail: "\"It's within us. A single whiff of this fragrance, drawn from the highly scented blossom of the bitter orange tree, augmented by a hint of civet, resonates within us\""
fiole.fleursdoranger.content: "\"A perfume as simple as its name: “Fleurs d’oranger”...Orange  Blossom. An  intoxicating  heady  fragrance, created  using  fresh  white  flowers that sing with the scent of happiness... Born  also  of  the  Sevilla  orange,  brought  into  Europe  from  Arabia  in  the  11th century... And of \"Narendy\", which exhilarated all of Europe with its delicious perfume in the 18th century, when it was also known as the essence of Neroli, christened thus by the woman who craved it most, the Duchess of Neroli. Orange blossom... the blossom on a tree, a whispering breeze, a baby’s kiss. It's the enchantress.\""

fiole.boisvanille.title: "Un bois vanille"
fiole.boisvanille.detail: "\"To paraphrase Freud, it's not the Evil who is full of regrets, but the Good. Both the devil and vanilla like black. No sentimentality here! Within each of us, this mellowness grows stronger and more refined thanks to contrasting wood notes.\""
fiole.boisvanille.content: "\"The year is 1519. Texcoco, the capital of the Aztec Empire, more vast and more beautiful than Cordoba stands in all its splendour.On November 8, under a clear sky, the Emperor Montezuma, his court and his 500 000 subjects receive Hernan Cortez and his men in absolute luxury.Most of the pyramids of the city are layered with gold, the highest one at the Imperial Palace is topped with an emerald the size of an open hand.During  a  ceremonial  dinner,  servants  offer  Montezuma  gold  chalices  which  contain  a  foamy  drink  made  of  vanilla,  coconut  and  peppers,  which  he  enjoys  very much. Cortez is overwhelmed by the richness of this stupendous culture. But  Montezuma  has  second  thoughts  about  the  Spaniards.  In  fact  Spain  is  in  desperate need of gold and will use any excuse to get it, including evangelical missions.Two years have now passed and the wondrous city of Texcoco is no more, and its culture which had produced the best craftsmen of their time is annihilated. From their  pillage  and  destruction,  the  Conquistadors  have  brought  back  many  treasures, including emerald flasks, multicoloured feathered coats and dresses, skulls made out of rock-crystal and also some vanilla, but nothing has retained their attention as much as the gold. Nowadays  vanilla  is  still  cultivated  as  it  was  prior  to  1519  by  the  Totomac  Indians. Out of this History of terror came a fragrance, a rich, woody vanilla, smoky, velvety, mysterious and enchanting. The mythological witness of the longing for a vanished world.\""

fiole.nuitcellophane.title: "Nuit de cellophane"
fiole.nuitcellophane.detail: "\"When, beneath its cellophane, the Haute Couture was but yet an idea. Are you familiar with the scent of osmanthus? The flower is white or tinged with orange. From the tight clusters of its petals bursts the scent of jasmine laced with mandarin orange. On hot summer days, it provides a breath of fresh air.\""
fiole.nuitcellophane.content: "\"As the night unfolds, it reveals a cluster of heavenly bodies. The velvet pirouette of moths fluttering around glowing lanterns. Creatures of darkness, crickets and other dwellers of the shadows lying undercover, transmit their requests.\n
- \"Excuse me, miss? Could you wrap that please?\"\n
- \"Is it a gift, sir?\"\n
- \"Indeed it is, a gift for you.\""

fiole.feminitebois.title: "Féminité du bois"
fiole.feminitebois.detail: "\"This scent expresses the masculine side of femininity and vice-versa. It's all about cedar and it's composed of 60% wood. Amazed, people called it revolutionary. The fragrance took on its own identity, which is the one thing that really matters to me.\""
fiole.feminitebois.content: "\"The name speaks for itself. An event in 1992 ! A  specific  wood,  cedar  to  be  precise.  Sweet,  resinous,  musky ...  I  was  enchanted by its exquisite artistry.I don’t deserve credit for going against convention or swimming against the tide... it's like second nature to me, Shockwaves in the small world of perfumery.Popular opinion sets the trends.One was constantly digging deeper, so deep that there was nothing else to be discovered, and of course you found yourself on the other side, back where you started. Better to start over again. \"Féminité\" never left me, it just came back.\""

fiole.lorpheline.title: "L'orpheline"
fiole.lorpheline.detail: "\"Brittle but whole. Its name hints at a break but before the cracks show, the first two syllables carry the name of the poet Orpheus, who could charm even the stones.\""
fiole.lorpheline.content: "\"1. Yet another girl!\n
Yes, if you think of her as the abandoned part of myself. As a child, I have cut the world in half. On the one side, a girl, The Vanquished – not the lsoser! - and more precisely, that which germinated in her and which in myself, I raised; and on the other side, a boy, The Victorious.\n\n
For a child, the world comes down to three people: himself, his mother and his father.Without everyone making a choice as clear-cut as mine, each of them will be dependent on it for the rest of his life.\n\n
2. Did you choose the mother?\n
Not the mother, her wound; I bore it. It is undeniably an identification. As for each and every one of us, I owe my life to chance. The famous throw of the dice seems exemplary to me – it is quite a number – it is the one which leads us to where we should have been born or not to have been. I will not recall the significant episodes of my destiny but, between what was and what I felt, the difference was major. However, the child is the clairvoyant: he foresees. Since the wound had all the qualities of a feminine one, she adored me.\n\n
3. From that time on, should we understand that the masculine side was denied in you?\n
From what to my eyes was officially required: the army, authority, power, order, moralism, yes. I was at war with the Male: Evil. Considering that from that moment on, I invent a woman for myself and bring us to light, it is the baptism of blood.\n\n
4. Coming back to the orphan girl. Is it you?\n
No,  originally  it  was  a  virgin  land,  it  attracted  me  but  I  didn’t  recognise  myself there; this territory that I refused myself was that of men. My mother, she was the wrath and I, her son, her revenge.\n\n
5. And the father, where is he?\n
The father is the declared enemy. I was hatred on Earth, on Father. Of the mother I was the figurehead, and of the father the assassin. The wound did not heal.I could be blinded  but I could see: the father was immortal. From him I could keep the feminine he disowned.\n\n
6. How did you rediscover the route to perfume in this labyrinth?\n
It's the memory of it, the forgiveness and of what today has survived, the dust. Not only is it feminine but it has no plural. It is the wake of my life, that which remains when all has gone. It is the invisible which, veil after veil, there where it is forgotten, fades into grey.\"\n\n"
